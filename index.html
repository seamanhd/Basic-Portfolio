		<p> Hi! My name is Heather Seaman and I am a web development student. I have experience with both design and development and enjoy working with both sides of the process! I love helping small businesses express a mission and brand in unique and professional ways. </p>

		<p> Some of my design skills include competency with Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator for both print and web design. I have a working knowledge of basic front-end development, including Git, HTML, and CSS. You can find more about me on GitHub, and connect with me through the contact form. I look forward to hearing from you! </p>
